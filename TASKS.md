# ADR-0022 task evidence

## Capacity fixture and local gate

- [x] Versioned deterministic, numeric-only 12-month fixtures for 40, 80, and 100
  recording hours per month, with exact derived distributions.
- [x] Declared and validated the 32-GiB SQLite ceiling and a sparse near-ceiling extent
  profile without committing generated data.
- [x] Added a separate, opt-in production-shaped local gate with profile-derived disk
  preflight, bounded streaming batches, exact per-kind distribution checks, SQLite
  DB/WAL/checkpoint observations over materialized content-free payload/vector-shape BLOBs,
  and content-free reports.
- [x] Kept Phase-0a smoke tests fast and permanently non-evidence; the long gate is not
  executed in CI contract tests.
- [ ] Bind a future release-only suite to a signed production image and exercise archive-v3
  VFS, backend, witness, fault, lifecycle, cache, and concurrency paths before any
  authority transition.

The checked items do not authorize archive-v3 persistence or deployment. See
[`eval/capacity/README.md`](eval/capacity/README.md) for the reproducible operator command
and the local gate's explicit limitations.
